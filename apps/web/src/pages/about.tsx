          <Box>What do these glasses symbolize?</Box>

          <Box>
            To us, they symbolize a powerful new model <br /> for collective creation.
          </Box>

          <Box>
            A shared vision. <br /> And a shared realization of that vision. <br /> The
            seed of one idea. <br />
            And the infinite ideas that can grow from it. <br /> From coming up together.{' '}
            <br /> To taking over together.
          </Box>

          <img src={'/why.svg'} alt="" />

          <Box>
            We built Nouns Builder to proliferate this new model so anyone can build with
            it. <br /> Why? <br /> Because the old ways of doing great things together
            aren’t so great anymore.
          </Box>

          <Box>
            What if… <br /> Instead of relying on corporations, <br /> we created together
            and relied on each other? <br />
            Instead of just creating short-term revenue,
            <br /> we created lasting resonance?
            <br /> Instead of trusting hidden systems, <br /> we did everything openly
            onchain? <br />
            Instead of working together feeling like work, <br /> it could feel like an
            endless jam session?
          </Box>

          <Box>
            We built Nouns Builder <br />
            to make all of this more possible. <br /> For any idea to become an
            invitation. <br /> To create together.
          </Box>

          <Box>Is Nouns Builder made by Nouns or by ZORA? Yes.</Box>

          <Box>
            Nouns Builder exists in the spirit of co-creation. <br /> We are part of Nouns
            and Nouns are a part of us.
          </Box>

          <Box>
            Is Nouns Builder its own Nouns style DAO? Yes. <br /> It’s called Builder DAO.{' '}
            <br />
            Our intention is to open more doors for <br />
            more people to help realize this vision together. <br /> And it was important
            we actually use this tool to do it.
